### About
`IIITVR (IIIT Virtual Relationship)` is a virtual relationship provider. It helps people maintain a virtual relationship like in the metaverse. The users can opt for their preferences based on which a virtual environment and people are created to accompany the user. The platform lets users chat with other users/avatars in the metaverse and post pictures online. This mini-world fulfils the line - 
> “Love is better off as virtual. You should feel it from far. Rather not touch it. And it will always be there for you.”
